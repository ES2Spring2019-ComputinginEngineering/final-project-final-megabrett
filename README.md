# Analysis of energy production and usage - Team Megabrett

In this project we analyzed energy usage per city by creating a spreadsheet of cities, their coordinates, and their populations, then applying estimates for monthly 
personal energy usage to deduce the energy needed to power different cities. We then included a Knearest neighbor classification system that will tell you the knearest cities
to a certain coordinate point that the user chooses, and calculates how much energy is required to power those Knearest cities.

## Instructions

All that the user needs to do is open the file "main.py", run it in a python editor that will allow graphing, and run the program. Follow the prompts that appear on the console
to input your desired coordinate points and K value, and then the computer will automatically tell you the Knearest cities and their energy requirements.

## File List

README - instructions
main.py - the actual code that you need to run
ReadDataFinal.py - basically the first half of main.py - used for testing different functions without editing the actual final code. Could've been removed, but I wanted to show
	the steps I took to create this project
Latitude and Longitude of major us cities.csv - spreadsheet including the coordinate and population data for major US cities
