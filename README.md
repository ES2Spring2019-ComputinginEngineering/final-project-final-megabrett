# This is your Final Project ReadMe Template

The file is inside your final project repository called "README.md"

You should include in your final project readme a description of the project, a list of all the files that you have created and instructions for use.

This readme is written in a language called markdown. This is not a programming language but a formatting langauge. There are symbols (syntax) used to indicate how to format the text. For example the pound symbol (i.e. the hashtag) is used to format a title; two of the same symbol format a heading, and three format a sub-heading.

Below is some example text in markdown however this alone is not suffiecent for the final project. **Make sure you follow the directions on Canvas.**

# Analysis of energy production and usage - Team Megabrett

In this project we analyzed energy usage per city by creating a spreadsheet of cities, their coordinates, and their populations, then applying estimates for monthly 
personal energy usage to deduce the energy needed to power different cities. We then included a Knearest neighbor classification system that will tell you the knearest cities
to a certain coordinate point that the user chooses, and calculates how much energy is required to power those Knearest cities.

## Instructions

All that the user needs to do is open the file "main.py", run it in a python editor that will allow graphing, and run the program. Follow the prompts that appear on the console
to input your desired coordinate points and K value, and then the computer will automatically tell you the Knearest cities and their energy requirements.

## File List

README - instructions
main.py - the actual code that you need to run
ReadDataFinal.py - basically the first half of main.py - used for testing different functions without editing the actual final code. Could've been removed, but I wanted to show
	the steps I took to create this project
Latitude and Longitude of major us cities.csv - spreadsheet including the coordinate and population data for major US cities
